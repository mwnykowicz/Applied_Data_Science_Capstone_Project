# Applied_Data_Science_Capstone_Project
Working on Falcon 9 data to predict if first stage will land successfully.

# Project Background
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by significantly reducing the cost of space travel. While traditional rocket launches can exceed $165 million, SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches for just $62 million – largely thanks to its ability to reuse the rocket’s first stage. In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the first stage will successfully land. This gives an estimate, whether the first stage of the rocket can be reused and what will be the launch cost.

# Problems to be solved
Analyze how payload mass, launch site, number of previous flights, and orbit type influence the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.
Examine trends in landing success rates over time to determine whether performance has improved.
Identify and train the most effective machine learning algorithm to predict the first stage reuse.
